Introduction
============

Welcome to the official documentation for CRYSTALClear, a Python framework 
designed to streamline the analysis of solid-state simulations performed with 
the quantum-chemistry code CRYSTAL. CRYSTALClear serves as a powerful tool for 
researchers and scientists working in the fields of materials science, 
computational chemistry, and condensed matter physics, enabling the efficient 
extraction and visualization of data from CRYSTAL's output files.

CRYSTALClear was born as a fork from `"CRYSTALpytools" <cpt_>`_. , an existing 
GitHub repository, building on its foundation to deliver enhanced functionality 
and user experience. This project expands upon the original codebase, 
adding new features, improved usability, and more comprehensive documentation 
to better support the needs of the computational chemistry community.

   intuitive interface that minimizes the learning curve. With straightforward 
   commands and comprehensive documentation, users can quickly set up and 
   execute their analysis workflows without needing to write complex code from 
   scratch.
#. **Extraction of Quantities from Output Files**: Seamlessly retrieve and 
   manipulate data from CRYSTAL output files, reducing the need for manual 
   parsing and data handling.
#. **Band Structure and Density of States (DOSS)**: Generate detailed plots of band 
   structures and density of states, providing insights into the electronic 
   properties of materials.
#. **Elastic Properties**: Calculate and visualize key mechanical properties such as 
   Young's modulus, shear modulus, linear compressibility, and Poisson ratio, 
   aiding in the characterization of material strength and elasticity.
#. **Vibrational Spectroscopy (IR and Raman)**: Analyze both harmonic and anharmonic 
   infrared (IR) and Raman spectra, enabling the study of vibrational modes in 
   crystals.
#. **Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) Analysis**: Perform sophisticated 
   analyses of electron density and related properties, crucial for 
   understanding chemical bonding and reactivity in solids.
#. **Electron Transport Properties**: Investigate the electron transport 
   characteristics of materials, essential for the design of semiconductors and 
   other electronic devices.
